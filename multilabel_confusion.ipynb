       "    \"The method of extracting nematodes from the soil developed by Jenkins was combined with the Coolen and D'Herde technique with the aim of optimising the extraction of heteroderid cysts from the soil. In addition to the soil, the combined methodology employs 40-mesh (420 mu m) and 200-mesh (74 mu m) sieves, kaolin and sucrose. Using this method, it is possible to obtain quickly almost four times the number of cysts in an almost clear suspension, compared to the traditional method of cyst-extraction devised by Shepherd.\",\n",

This paper systematically reviews models of the economic impacts of forest disturbances and summarizes four commonly applied models, which are \"with and without\" analysis, equilibrium models, the intervention model, and the social welfare model. The advantages and disadvantages of these four models are presented and compared, and literature using these models is introduced. The review of the economic assessment of damage caused by forest disturbances is expected to provide insights for researchers in this field and useful information about economic losses, price dynamics, and welfare redistribution for policymakers.',\n",
       "    'An intrinsic part of our lives as scientists, academic writing strongly affects our careers. Even great researchers are much more likely to be successful if they are also proficient writers. Unfortunately, many researchers prefer long hours spent in the field or laboratory to writing. Often, this is a result of their reluctance towards writing, something that characterizes not only scientists, but many people in general. But many researchers do not like writing because they do not know how to do it well-academic writing is not that simple. In this paper, I show how to improve your academic writing skills. I do not teach writing; instead, I share my experience about learning how to write.'],\n",

       "    \"China has the world's largest sheep flock and the largest producer of sheep meat by far. However, the nutrient requirements have not been systemically studied and there is a lack of knowledge of nutrient requirement for meat-type sheep in China. Since 2008, the nutrient requirements of meat-type sheep in China has been systematically investigated. In this review, we introduced the history of studies of nutrient requirements of meat-type sheep in China, summarized the recent advances in nutrient requirements of meat-type sheep, and highlighted the future directions of researches on nutrient requirements of meat-type sheep in China.\",\n",
       "    'The non-antimicrobial approaches we reviewed are summarized in Table 1. Beyond options that alter energy density and fermentability of the diet, based on current data, the only area that might have the potential to yield actionable results is the use of probiotics and prebiotics. Development of reproducible in vitro and in vivo models for rapid testing of non-antimicrobial approaches would advance research in this area. In addition, understanding the role of the lower small intestine and the cecum and proximal colon in the development of liver abscess could be a worthwhile research focus.',\n",
       "    \"Animal breeding is an essential component of sustainable land-use systems with livestock. Therefore, it has to contribute its share to the solution of problems and conflicts in the areas of animal welfare, environmental impacts, land-use change and feed-food competition. An important lever is the reduction of the number of livestock and the turnover rates. This will give opportunities to keep the remaining animals in more open husbandry systems. Further efficiency improvements are necessary, but Jevons' Paradox has until today caused productivity improvement to be used to increase production instead of saving resources. Therefore, stronger regulations will be required to control the development of regional concentrations in line with consumer demands.\",\n",
       "    'Tomato cultivation and industrial processing produce a considerable amount of tomato pomace, peels, and seeds, which are difficult to handle.

There is growing interest in using DLD for harvesting circulating tumor cells from blood for further assays due to its low cost and robustness. While DLD is a powerful tool and development of high-throughput DLD separation devices holds great promise in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, much of the experimental data analysis in DLD research still relies on error-prone and time-consuming manual processes. There is a strong need to automate data analysis in microfluidic devices to reduce human errors and the manual processing time. In this work, a reliable particle detection method is developed as the basis for the DLD separation analysis. Python and its available packages are used for machine vision techniques, along with existing identification methods and machine learning models. Three machine learning techniques are implemented and compared in the determination of the DLD separation mode.

Conventionally, solid-state nanopores are prepared by etching or drilling openings in a silicon nitride (SiNx) substrate, which is expensive and requires a long processing time. To address these challenges, a CDB technique was introduced and used to fabricate nanopore channels in SiNx membranes. However, the nanopore sensors produced by the CDB result in a severe pore-to-pore diameter variation as a result of different fabrication conditions and processing times. Accordingly, it is indispensable to simultaneously fabricate nanopore sensors in the same environment to reduce the deleterious effects of pore-to-pore variation. In this study, we propose a four-channel CDB system that comprises an amplifier that boosts the command voltage, a 1-to-4 multiplexer, a level shifter, a low-noise transimpedance amplifier and a data acquisition device. To prove our design concept, we used the CDB system to fabricate four nanopore sensors with diameters of <10 nm, and its in vitro performance was verified using lambda-DNA samples.'],\n",

Planning involves managing competing aims and economic interests in processes that are simultaneously political and technical: what many call \"a balancing act.\" Discourse analysis of the content and form of utterances involving the root balanc* suggests that the words people choose in describing planning can simultaneously reflect and obscure power relations and decision processes.',\n",
       "    \"Starting from a comparison between the Belep Islands (Kanaky New Caledonia) and O'ahu (Hawai'i), this paper aims to contribute to the debates about islands and the Anthropocene, highlighting the relevance of the social and ecological responsibilities deriving from genealogical connections to the islands: 'the weight of the ancestors'. Considering the implications of these kinds of responsibilities can help to understand human and non-human relational entanglements better so as to value the agentive role of other-than-human perspectives.\",\n",
       "    \"The Rajapaksa government consolidated its position with new laws, special task forces, and public-sector appointments. With the opposition wiped out, Sri Lanka now has a unipolar political landscape. Two successive waves of COVID-19 infections caused a rising death toll and necessitated severe lockdowns. The resulting economic problems exposed structural weaknesses in Sri Lanka's macroeconomic constellation, with depleting foreign exchange and an acute debt burden. These interlocking crises triggered new forms of protest and a new convergence of previously disparate societal opposition.\",\n",
       "    'This article introduces global studies to an Aotearoa New Zealand audience with the goal of thinking through what human geographers might learn by comparing elements of global studies with their own discipline. It begins by reviewing global studies and its establishment at The University of Auckland and then considers how global studies relates to human geography. A number of areas of mutual benefit are identified. The relationship between global studies and human geography is important to consider during a time of change within higher education in Aotearoa, a point discussed in the conclusion.'],\n",

This article focuses on sensor journalism, which brings new practical and ethical concerns to journalism. By interviewing and working with data journalists and journalism scholars, we analyze the new technological and ethical challenges that sensors bring to journalism. The results contribute to the knowledge on how data journalists implicitly embed ethical values into their everyday work. Furthermore, they suggest that general ethical values are revisited and extended by the influence of sensors.',\n",
       "    \"This study explored students' perceptions of the library's impact on their academic success based on open-ended responses from a 2018 survey assessing student use and satisfaction. The qualitative findings demonstrated differences in the library resources students perceived as contributing to their achievements, based on such demographics as race, class, program, and college. Also, the results revealed that success is multifaceted and more than just a number determined by a high GPA (grade point average). More qualitative research exploring student defined success and library impact is needed.\",\n",
       "    'To improve customer service, some academic libraries have used a service philosophy statement to foster a shared understanding of service standards. The authors conducted semi -structured interviews with heads of public services at academic libraries to understand how the service philosophy statement was used in practice and its impact on staff behavior and service quality. Findings indicated that the statement indeed helped staff cultivate a shared understanding, that public service leaders displayed a macro-level understanding of how a statement influences their service culture, and that there is no agreed-upon model for implementation.',\n",

Interviews with academic librarians, library administrators, and library staff examined the ways in which they conceptualize diversity and how these perceptions impact their daily practices. Findings suggest that librarians and staff conceive of diversity broadly, frame all engagement with students in terms of teaching and learning, and actively pursue professional development opportunities to strengthen their cultural competence skills. Professional, institutional, and individual implications of these findings are discussed.',\n",

The present study explores an under-discussed but material aspect of the job; namely, how lifestyle journalists undertake issues of hostility. Through the lens of the theory of hostility towards the press and in-depth interviews with lifestyle journalists (n = 24), this study argues that journalists tend to cover issues of hate against their audience members but seek to ignore harassment when directed at them.'],\n",

Two previous datasets were revisited, each confirming the relationship. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.\",\n",

He conceived it as a means to two ends: the strengthening of the EU and the protection of what he has referred to as 'European civilisation'. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shown that Macron's gamble has failed. As a result, some adjustments to Macron's foreign policy with respect to Russia are necessary and under way. Other aspects of his European policy, however, remain sensible and more relevant than ever.\",\n",

Thus it is not surprising that there have already been many excellent literary interpretations focusing on these works. My aim is not to augment this list, but instead I intend to shed some light on the less-investigated political message of these dramas. In other words, I am attempting to re-read Kalidasa's plays as pieces of political theatre.\",\n",

It cautions against embracing a single story to account for a long historical period, especially if that story fits our modern concerns too neatly; even more importantly, we have to allow the primary sources to take the lead, rather than looking for and presenting only evidence that serves a particular agenda.',\n",
