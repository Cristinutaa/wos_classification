Furthermore, we also review monoclonal antibody production platforms and new technologies that are critical aspects of differentiation strategies in the biopharmaceutical CDMO.", "Synthetic colorants have predominated over natural colorants mainly due to their relatively more stable color, larger synthesis scale, and lower manufacturing costs. However, the environmental and health impacts arising from the excess use of these chemicals have brought up increasing demand for natural colorants. Recent advances in microbial metabolic engineering are enabling an increasing number of natural colorants to be manufactured at large scale in a greener and sustainable manner. In this paper, we review the metabolic engineering tools and strategies employed for the microbial production of natural colorants and their derivatives, focusing on the enhanced production of major natural colorants and diversification of natural colorants with more desirable physicochemical properties. Future prospects and challenges are also discussed.", "Microalgae are utilized for various purposes through cell content extraction and application. Cell walls are not utilized and not studied in an extensive manner. At the same time, composition of multilayer and fibrillar structures with various chemical compositions depends on microalgae species, they present an interesting object for chromatography. However, it requires the application of novel processing technologies (such as pulsed electric fields [PEFs]), which are able to selectively permeabilize the cell walls with pores of various sizes and shapes. The current review indicates the application of potential of microalgae cell walls for separation by size exclusion, ion-exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. However, such a hypothesis should be further experimentally proven.", "The coupling of individual models in terms of end-to-end calculations for unit operations in manufacturing processes is a challenging task. We present a probability distribution-based approach for the combined outcomes of parametric and non-parametric models. With this so-called Bayesian predictive ensemble, the statistical moments such as mean value and standard deviation can be accurately computed without any further approximation. It is shown that the ensemble of different model predictions leads to an uninformed prior distribution, which can be transformed into a predictive posterior distribution using Bayesian inference and numerical Markov Chain Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate the advantages of our method using several numerical examples. Our approach is not restricted to certain unit operations, and can also be used for the more robust interpretation and assessment of model predictions in general.", "Therapeutic proteins or biologics are used to treat many diseases including cancer and autoimmune disorders, however, manufacturing these types of drugs typically requires enormous, costly facilities to meet demand and a cold supply chain for product transport, which often leads to logistical delays. A proposed solution to these issues is the development of a portable system to produce biotherapeutics at the pointof-care based on a miniaturized bioprocess. Some of the greatest challenges in this approach revolve around the purification section of the process, as certain difficulties arise from the scale-down of the downstream unit operations performed in traditional bioprocesses.

However, in conventional granules, the macropore interconnectivity is poor and has varying size. Herein, we developed a productive method for fabricating carbonate apatite honeycomb granules with uniformly sized macropores based on extrusion molding. Each honeycomb granule possesses three hexagonal macropores of ~290 mu m along its diagonal. Owing to these macropores, honeycomb granules simultaneously formed new and mature bone and blood vessels in both the interior and exterior of the granules at 4 weeks after implantation. The honeycomb granules are useful for achieving rapid osteogenesis and angiogenesis.", "As bone biology develops, it is gradually recognized that bone regeneration is a pathophysiological process that requires the simultaneous participation of multiple systems. With the introduction of osteoimmunology, the interplay between the immune system and the musculoskeletal diseases has been the conceptual framework for a thorough understanding of both systems and the advancement of osteoimmunomodulaty biomaterials. Various therapeutic strategies which include intervention of the surface characteristics or the local delivery systems with the incorporation of bioactive molecules have been applied to create an ideal bone microenvironment for bone tissue regeneration. Our review systematically summarized the current research that is being undertaken in the field of osteoimmunomodulaty bone biomaterials on a case-by-case basis, aiming to inspire more extensive research and promote clinical conversion.", "Due to excellent mechanical properties and similar elastic modulus compared with human cortical bone, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) has become one of the most promising orthopedic implant materials.

However, adaptations of standardised care methodologies can only provide so many novel solutions for patients and caregivers alike. Similarly, unique methods such as nanoscopic liposomal package delivery for analgesics and affective numbing agents pose a similar issue-specifically that we are still left with the dilemma of patients for whom analgesics and numbing agents are ineffective or harmful. An examination of the potential gains that may result from the targeted development of nanorobotics for anaesthesia in perioperative care will be presented in this essay to help resolve this pending conflict for the research community. This examination should therefore serve as a \"call to action\" for such research and a \"primer\" for those for whom the method's implementation would most directly impact.", "The traditional infectious disease detection process is cumbersome, and there is only a single application scenario. In recent years, with the development of the medical industry and the impact of the epidemic situation, the number of infectious disease detection instruments based on nursing point detection has been increasing. Due to this trend, many detection instruments and massive detection data urgently need to be managed. In addition, the experiment failed due to the abnormal fluorescence curve generated by a human operator or sample impurities. Finally, the geographic information system has also played an active role in spreading and preventing infectious diseases; this paper designs a \"detection-service-mobile\" three-terminal system to realize the control of diagnostic instruments and the comprehensive management of data. Machine learning is used to classify the enlarged curve and calculate the cycle threshold of the positive curve; combined with a geographic information system, the detection results are marked on the mobile terminal map to realize the visual display of the positive results of nucleic acid amplification detection and the early warning of infectious diseases. In the research, applying this system to portable field pathogen detection is feasible and practical.", "Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a microfluidic method for the continuous separation of particles based on their size. There is growing interest in using DLD for harvesting circulating tumor cells from blood for further assays due to its low cost and robustness. While DLD is a powerful tool and development of high-throughput DLD separation devices holds great promise in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, much of the experimental data analysis in DLD research still relies on error-prone and time-consuming manual processes. There is a strong need to automate data analysis in microfluidic devices to reduce human errors and the manual processing time. In this work, a reliable particle detection method is developed as the basis for the DLD separation analysis. Python and its available packages are used for machine vision techniques, along with existing identification methods and machine learning models. Three machine learning techniques are implemented and compared in the determination of the DLD separation mode. The program provides a significant reduction in video analysis time in DLD separation, achieving an overall particle detection accuracy of 97.86% with an average computation time of 25.274 s.", "In this study, we propose a low-area multi-channel controlled dielectric breakdown (CDB) system that simultaneously produces several nanopore sensors. Conventionally, solid-state nanopores are prepared by etching or drilling openings in a silicon nitride (SiNx) substrate, which is expensive and requires a long processing time. To address these challenges, a CDB technique was introduced and used to fabricate nanopore channels in SiNx membranes. However, the nanopore sensors produced by the CDB result in a severe pore-to-pore diameter variation as a result of different fabrication conditions and processing times. Accordingly, it is indispensable to simultaneously fabricate nanopore sensors in the same environment to reduce the deleterious effects of pore-to-pore variation. In this study, we propose a four-channel CDB system that comprises an amplifier that boosts the command voltage, a 1-to-4 multiplexer, a level shifter, a low-noise transimpedance amplifier and a data acquisition device. To prove our design concept, we used the CDB system to fabricate four nanopore sensors with diameters of <10 nm, and its in vitro performance was verified using lambda-DNA samples."], "titles": ["Development of Magnetic Nanoparticles and Encapsulation Methods - An Overview", "\"Compoundless Anaesthesia\", Controlled Administration, and Post-Operative Recovery Acceleration: Musings on Theoretical Nanomedicine Applications", "A Detection-Service-Mobile Three-Terminal Software Platform for Point-of-Care Infectious Disease Detection System", "Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) Analysis Tool Utilizing Machine Learning towards High-Throughput Separation", "Low-Area Four-Channel Controlled Dielectric Breakdown System Design for Point-of-Care Applications"]}, "other engineering and technologies": {"description": "Food and beverages; Other engineering and technologies", "abstracts": ["As we begin our survey of the infrared (IR) spectra of polymers containing C-O bonds, we discuss epoxies, perhaps the most economically important functional group in this category.

The analysis allows us to conclude that the size of the exchange is an influencing parameter. Since 2018, when the significant growth in the number of exchanges became a reality, smaller exchanges have shown strong herding behaviour, whereas large exchanges seem to respond to their own information and beliefs and lead the process of price definition. This result may originate some temporary profitable strategies in the process of evolution towards efficiency according to the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis.", "This paper documents that managers of multinational companies adjust voluntary disclosure after significant events at international subsidiaries. We show an increase in the likelihood and frequency of management forecasts following natural disasters in regions where companies operate subsidiaries. The exogenous and staggered nature of natural disasters as well as our research design choices substantially raise the hurdle for alternative explanations of our result. Further analyses suggest that the effect is particularly strong for companies that rely on equity financing. Our paper contributes to the nascent literature on transmission effects within international business groups.", "Drawing on a sample of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, we develop and test for a two-sided dynamic learning model to assess the degree of learning-by-lending in bank branches and learning-by-repaying for borrowers. The results show that learning-by-lending is negligible; however, learning-by-repaying is small but meaningful, with a shallow learning curve slope of 0.2. The findings have implications for two-sided learning and for policymakers aiming to lower defaults in SBA loans.", "This paper develops a location model of media bias with asymmetric media quality. In the model, media quality is defined as an ability to reduce the boundedly rational consumers' efforts in reasoning information. The model shows that an equilibrium bias exists unless the cost of a high-quality media outlet for adjusting bias is small enough. The size and location of the equilibrium bias gap between media outlets depend on the quality difference. The results may provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing views that competition increases or lessens the media bias."], "titles": ["Strategic delegation under rational and fulfilled expectations in quantity competition", "If the bitcoin market grows, size matters", "The effect of international subsidiaries on voluntary disclosure-evidence from natural disasters", "Learning-by-lending and learning-by-repaying: A two-sided learning model for defaults on Small Business Administration loans", "Media bias with asymmetric media quality"]}, "educational sciences": {"description": "Education, general; including training, pedagogy, didactics; Education, special (to gifted persons, those with learning disabilities)", "abstracts": ["In this study, we examine principals' data use within four districts are engaged in district-level professional learning around equity.

It analyses the reasons that have been given for the lack of progress made. It suggests that the current Western paradigms obstruct a view of current and expected developments in this area. It offers a new analysis, based on the evolution of enrolment rates in education. The paper argues that in the next decade or so, a transition to using African languages more at all levels of education will become unavoidable.", "This study examines pre-service teachers' construction of ethical roles in teaching practice in China. This study finds that three major changes emerged in pre-service teachers' understanding of teacher ethics after teaching practice: viewing caring as an interactive relationship between teachers and students, emphasising teachers' sacrifice, and highlighting authority in the teacher-student relationship. This study supplements the extant literature by highlighting university and teaching schools' roles in facilitating pre-service teachers in-depth interaction with pupils and teachers to facilitate their moral learning through fieldwork.", "In this article, the authors describe an English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher's attempt to provide more personalized support for her elementary English learners (ELs) during remote learning.

They then describe the benefits of using this tool and provide ideas on how to extend the use of voice recorders for ELs during traditional instruction.", "Educational leaders are facing unprecedented challenges that many do not feel prepared for, especially when it comes to promoting equity.

Such assessments should focus on the capacity of the evaluation units to produce high-quality evaluation reports which serve the needs of organizational decision-makers.

The construction of the poetic transcriptions and the artful method of analysis allows for a more explicit acknowledgment of the researchers' entanglements with both the data and the program being evaluated. Using a specific lens of identity, the authors posit that a culturally responsive approach to evaluation using arts-based analyses may reveal methodological and empirical insights overlooked in previous engagements with qualitative evaluation data.", "This essay discusses prison letters between Gabriele Tiedemann, a German national incarcerated in Switzerland from 1977-1991 for terrorism charges, and two women with whom she was incarcerated. This piece focuses on desire in the context of prison intimacies more broadly, and its expression in prison writing in particular. I argue that Tiedemann's writing illuminates the significance of physical contact for sustaining emotional and mental coherence as well as the limits of letters to maintain prison intimacies created and defined by close proximity.", "This short reflection considers how humanitarian workers conceptualize and practice \"the field\" as a site of action. Through the use of narrative ethnography, and drawing on comparisons with the practice of academic anthropology, it attempts to draw out disciplinary assumptions that govern how and where humanitarian action is undertaken. It demonstrates how the field is a central imaginary that underpins the principles and performance of both anthropology and humanitarian action.

Drawing on close to 200 US assessments of foreign countries' proliferation intentions between 1957 and 1966, this research note finds that close to 80 percent of testable US assessments were correct and that they shifted from highly inaccurate in the late 1950s to highly accurate in the 1960s. Based on quantitative and qualitative analysis, I conclude that learning from early failures led the intelligence community to achieve higher accuracy.", "Graduate public administration programs at Canadian universities have seen significant growth and change over the last fifteen years.
