 Example abstract:  
Return the most relevant classes for the FOLLOWING abstract. Return ONLY THE CLASSES separated by "&" in the ORDER OF RELEVANCE WITH THEIR RELEVANCE SCORE (between 0 and 100) in one line and never any aditional context: 
{} 
Please, DON'T RETURN OTHER CLASSES, ONLY A SUBSET OF THE 7, otherwise the result is invalid!!! The results of my study depends on it.
 DON'T RETURN MORE THAN FIVE RESULTS. ONLY THE MOST RELEVANT AND MAX 5 (1,2,3,4,5 RESULTS)!!!! 
Example of answer: "physical sciences:70&mathematics:60"
