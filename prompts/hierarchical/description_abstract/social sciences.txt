Given the following 9 classes: psychology;economics and business;educational sciences;sociology;law;political science;social and economic geography;media and communications;other social sciences 
The classes description and example of abstracts: 
psychology: Psychology (including human - machine relations); Psychology, special (including therapy for learning, speech, hearing, visual and other physical and mental disabilities) 
 Example abstract: An online group of career counseling for unemployed young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic was developed. Twelve participants were involved in online group career counseling intervention, based on the Life Design for an inclusive and sustainable future. Results indicated at post-test on increased scores on career adaptability, resilience, future orientation, and propensity to identify inclusive and sustainable actions for the future than pre-test. Overall, the online group career counseling intervention effectively promoted particular aspects of young adults' life design for an inclusive e-sustainable future. 
economics and business: Economics, Econometrics; Industrial relations; Business and Management 
 Example abstract: Drawing on a sample of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, we develop and test for a two-sided dynamic learning model to assess the degree of learning-by-lending in bank branches and learning-by-repaying for borrowers. The results show that learning-by-lending is negligible; however, learning-by-repaying is small but meaningful, with a shallow learning curve slope of 0.2. The findings have implications for two-sided learning and for policymakers aiming to lower defaults in SBA loans. 
educational sciences: Education, general; including training, pedagogy, didactics; Education, special (to gifted persons, those with learning disabilities) 
 Example abstract: This study examines pre-service teachers' construction of ethical roles in teaching practice in China. This study finds that three major changes emerged in pre-service teachers' understanding of teacher ethics after teaching practice: viewing caring as an interactive relationship between teachers and students, emphasising teachers' sacrifice, and highlighting authority in the teacher-student relationship. This study supplements the extant literature by highlighting university and teaching schools' roles in facilitating pre-service teachers in-depth interaction with pupils and teachers to facilitate their moral learning through fieldwork. 
sociology: Sociology; Demography; Anthropology, ethnology; Social topics (Women√≠s and gender studies; Social issues; Family studies, Social work) 
 Example abstract: In their funeral traditions, the Deang people, influenced by Southern (Theravada) Buddhism, recognize the zang (temple) but not the grave. In recent years, however, they have begun to recognize both the temple and the grave. Based on fieldwork, this study explores the process, practice, and logic of cultural reproduction behind this change, and looks at how the Deang people have engaged in the political discourse of national unity while rationalizing their changing funerary traditions. 
law: Law, criminology, penology 
 Example abstract: The paper argues that the principle of technological neutrality in copyright law is best grasped, not as a policy-driven imperative seeking to adapt copyright law to the exigencies of the digital environment, but rather as a principle immanent in the modern concept of copyright subject matter providing that merely technical or non-expressive uses of works of authorship do not attract liability. Technological neutrality is but a corollary of originality; that is, of the elementary proposition that copyright law protects original expression and nothing but original expression. 
political science: Political science; public administration; organisation theory 
 Example abstract: Graduate public administration programs at Canadian universities have seen significant growth and change over the last fifteen years. This research note assesses current programming and considers recent developments. We argue that Canadian public administration programs exhibit diversity and that they are responsive to key trends and forces shaping society. To support these claims, we compare program curriculums and highlight distinguishing features. We suggest in closing, though, that further adjustments are required for programs to take advantage of arising opportunities and to remain resilient in the face of new challenges. 
social and economic geography: Environmental sciences (social aspects); Cultural and economic geography; Urban studies (Planning and development); Transport planning and social aspects of transport (transport engineering to be Civil Engineering) 
 Example abstract: This article introduces global studies to an Aotearoa New Zealand audience with the goal of thinking through what human geographers might learn by comparing elements of global studies with their own discipline. It begins by reviewing global studies and its establishment at The University of Auckland and then considers how global studies relates to human geography. A number of areas of mutual benefit are identified. The relationship between global studies and human geography is important to consider during a time of change within higher education in Aotearoa, a point discussed in the conclusion. 
media and communications: Journalism; Information science (social aspects); Library science; Media and socio-cultural communication 
 Example abstract: This qualitative study explored cultural competence in two academic libraries at a major public research university in the Midwestern United States. Interviews with academic librarians, library administrators, and library staff examined the ways in which they conceptualize diversity and how these perceptions impact their daily practices. Findings suggest that librarians and staff conceive of diversity broadly, frame all engagement with students in terms of teaching and learning, and actively pursue professional development opportunities to strengthen their cultural competence skills. Professional, institutional, and individual implications of these findings are discussed. 
other social sciences: Social sciences, interdisciplinary; Other social sciences 
 Example abstract: Reviewing a recent book about early medieval Chinese geographical writings, this essay asks what sort of historical contextualization is needed for historical study, and suggests looking at multiple factors, including the material conditions of textual production, that may be responsible for the proliferation of texts. It cautions against embracing a single story to account for a long historical period, especially if that story fits our modern concerns too neatly; even more importantly, we have to allow the primary sources to take the lead, rather than looking for and presenting only evidence that serves a particular agenda.
