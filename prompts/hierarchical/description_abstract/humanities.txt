Given the following 8 classes: history;archaeology;languages and linguistics;literature;philosophy and ethics;religion;arts (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music);other humanities 
The classes description and example of abstracts: 
history: History (history of science and technology to be in Educational Sciences, history of specific sciences to be under the respective headings) 
 Example abstract: This article analyzes how the Peruvian doctors Carlos Enrique Paz Soldan and Juan B. Lastres were intermediaries in the circulation, transfer and adaptation of the knowledge produced by historians of medicine from Peru, through the United States and Europe. These efforts were part of the conviction that medical humanism would train physicians with empathy for their patients and that past Peruvian medical practices had to be part of universal history. This allowed Peruvians to participate, at least for some time, in the medical history international network. 
archaeology: Archaeology 
 Example abstract: As suggested by the title, this paper explores two of the several archaeological sites that configure religious loci in the territory of the current United Arab Emirates. It does so by assessing their relevance, by refining their nature and historical context, and by analyzing their positioning as components of a tourism mix. The core research question is whether or not integration is accomplished. Both structures are quite well known in the academic literature and underwent excavation and conservation investments that allow their proper use and promotion. Discussion and conclusions identify challenges for achieving an appropriate integration with conditioning supply factors. 
languages and linguistics: General language studies; Specific languages; Linguistics 
 Example abstract: This paper deals with the Italian presuppositional negation marker mica. This particle can surface differently in the negative circuit e.g. either in a clause-initial or a clause-internal position. However, depending on its position, different types of focus and pragmatic requirements are found. We consider the initial mica as an instance of corrective focus and the clause-internal one as encoding a more generic contrastive focus. We show that this is in line with the recent findings on focus typology of Italian. 
literature: General literature studies; Literary theory; Specific literatures 
 Example abstract: This article provides newly unearthed details about the specimens of taxidermy and anthropomorphic groups produced by Carl Akeley (1864-1926) in his private studio in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, before he embarked on his career in museums. The essay uses Akeley's decorative work and 'grotesque groups' as a springboard to explore the broader context of the rise of decorative taxidermy in the USA in the late nineteenth century, and the influence of European taxidermy on that trend. 
philosophy and ethics: Philosophy, History and philosophy of science and technology; Ethics (except ethics related to specific subfields) 
 Example abstract: A popular view of harming is the causal account (CA), on which harming is causing harm. CA has several attractive features. In particular, it appears well equipped to deal with the most important problems for its main competitor, the counterfactual comparative account (CCA). However, we argue that, despite its advantages, CA is ultimately an unacceptable theory of harming. Indeed, while CA avoids several counterexamples to CCA, it is vulnerable to close variants of some of the problems that beset CCA. 
religion: Theology; Religious studies 
 Example abstract: This article critiques Enrique Dussel's use of the conversion of Bartolome de Las Casas to ground his argument for a clear correspondence between Christian economic and eucharistic participation. Portraying justice as the result of an epiphanic conversion, Dussel implies a sudden and enduring ethical purity that undermines the justice he wants to call forth. I argue that a closer reading of the life of Las Casas offers a more truthful way to account for eucharistic practice under the pervasive structures of late capitalism. 
arts (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music): Arts, Art history; Architectural design; Performing arts studies (Musicology, Theater science, Dramaturgy); Folklore studies; Studies on Film, Radio and Television 
 Example abstract: In this transcribed conversation, three artists from the U.K. research group The Cultural Negotiation of Science (CNoS) share the generational perspectives they bring to the contested field of arts-science research. Traversing territories between art-practice, physics, genetics and critical theory, their practice-based strategies actively destabilize the binary nature of cross-disciplinary dialogue in productive ways, allowing the spaces between artistic and scientific modes of inquiry to become sites of learning, both within and beyond academic institutions. 
other humanities: Other humanities 
 Example abstract: Although not pendants in the traditional sense, since they were painted for different patrons, it is argued here that Carle Van Loo's 'A pasha having his mistress's portrait painted' and 'The Grand Turk giving a concert to his mistress, shown at the Salon of1737, were meant to be read as a pair - as portraits of the artist and his wife and as allegories of Painting and Music. By linking the paintings, Van Loo may have intended them to make a statement on the changing relations between art and patronage.
