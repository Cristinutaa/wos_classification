 Example abstract: One of the greatest challenges in business consulting is to help clients quickly grasp how the products and services you offer will improve their organizations. As businesswomen whose adult lives have been spent implementing behavioral solutions in large companies and complex organizations, we have amassed experience and advice for those who seek to help others achieve sustainable improvements through behaviorally based solutions. It starts with getting them to understand and believe in what you are proposing. This paper outlines advice and strategies gained over three decades of marketing and implementing behavioral solutions in large organizations. 
clinical medicine: Andrology; Obstetrics and gynaecology; Paediatrics; Cardiac and Cardiovascular systems; Peripheral vascular disease; Hematology; Respiratory systems; Critical care medicine and Emergency medicine; Anaesthesiology; Orthopaedics; Surgery; Radiology, nuclear medicine and medical imaging; Transplantation; Dentistry, oral surgery and medicine; Dermatology and venereal diseases; Allergy; Rheumatology; Endocrinology and metabolism (including diabetes, hormones); Gastroenterology and hepatology; Urology and nephrology; Oncology; Ophthalmology; Otorhinolaryngology; Psychiatry; Clinical neurology; Geriatrics and gerontology; General and internal medicine; other clinical medicine subjects; Integrative and complementary medicine (alternative practice systems) 
 Example abstract: India has literally been devastated by the second wave of the Covid-19. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy which was approved initially for Covid-19 in India has been recently excluded from the Covid-19 management protocol. Herein we would like to explore the major challenges for CP therapy in India that we observed during the current pandemic. Copyright (C) 2021 Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine (SFTS).

health sciences: Health care sciences and services (including hospital administration, health care financing); Health policy and services; Nursing; Nutrition, Dietetics; Public and environmental health; Tropical medicine; Parasitology; Infectious diseases; epidemiology; Occupational health; Sport and fitness sciences; Social biomedical sciences (includes family planning, sexual health, psycho-oncology, political and social effects of biomedical research); Medical ethics; Substance abuse 
 Example abstract: The increasing power and political involvement of nurses globally via international nursing organizations, such as Sigma Theta Tau, International and the International Council of Nurses, as well as in International Health Organizations, like Partners in Health, are discussed in this paper. The voice of nurses, like Holly Shaw at the United Nations, and influence of nurses in leadership positions, like Shelia Davis at Partners in Health, are examples of nurses using increasing power and influence in improving health globally. A brief nursing perspective on power is also included. 
health biotechnology: Health-related biotechnology; Technologies involving the manipulation of cells, tissues, organs or the whole organism (assisted reproduction); Technologies involving identifying the functioning of DNA, proteins and enzymes and how they influence the onset of disease and maintenance of well-being (gene-based diagnostics and therapeutic interventions (pharmacogenomics, gene-based therapeutics); Biomaterials (as related to medical implants, devices, sensors); Medical biotechnology related ethics 
 Example abstract: Autologous cell therapy uses patients' own cells to deliver precise and ideal treatment through a personalized medicine approach. Isolation of patients' cells from residual tissue extracted during surgery involves specific planning and lab steps. In the present manuscript, a path from isolation to in vitro research with human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from residual bone tissues is described as performed by a medical unit in collaboration with a research center. Ethical issues have been addressed by formulating appropriate harvesting protocols according to European regulations. Samples were collected from 19 patients; 10 of them were viable and after processing resulted in MSCs. MSCs were further differentiated in osteoblasts to investigate the biocompatibility of several 3D scaffolds produced by electrospinning and 3D printing technologies; traditional orthopedic titanium and nanostructured titanium substrates were also tested. 3D printed scaffolds proved superior compared to other substrates, enabling significantly improved response in osteoblast cells, indicating that their biomimetic structure and properties make them suitable for synthetic tissue engineering. The present research is a proof of concept that describes the process of primary stem cells isolation for in vitro research and opens avenues for the development of personalized cell platforms in the case of patients with orthopedic trauma. The demonstration model has promising perspectives in personalized medicine practices. 
other medical sciences: Forensic science; Other medical sciences
