Given the following 7 classes: mathematics;computer and information sciences;physical sciences;chemical sciences;earth and related environmental sciences;biological sciences;other natural sciences 
The classes description and example of abstracts: 
mathematics: Pure mathematics, Applied mathematics; Statistics and probability (this excludes applied statistics) 
 Example abstract: This paper considers approximation methods to find common fixed points for two general nonlinear mappings that contain generalized hybrid mappings or normally 2-generalized hybrid mappings. First, we combine Nakajo and Takahashi's hybrid method with a mean iteration method and prove three strong convergence theorems that approximate common fixed points for nonlinear mappings. We then develop Takahashi, Takeuchi and Kubota's shrinking projection method and prove three strong convergence theorems. Nonlinear mappings are not necessarily continuous or commutative. 
computer and information sciences: Computer sciences, information science and bioinformatics (hardware development to be in Electrical Engineering, social aspect to be in Media and Communication) 
 Example abstract: Tools that focus on static code analysis for early error detection are of utmost importance in software development, especially since the propagation of errors is strongly related to higher costs in the development process. Formal Concept Analysis is a prominent field of applied mathematics that uses conceptual landscapes to discover and represent maximal clusters of data. Its expressive visualization method makes it suitable for exploratory analyses in different fields. In this paper we present a Formal Concept Analysis framework for static code analysis that can serve as a model for quantitative and qualitative exploration and interpretation of such results. 
physical sciences: Atomic, molecular and chemical physics (physics of atoms and molecules including collision, interaction with radiation; magnetic resonances; Moessbauer effect); Condensed matter physics (including formerly solid state physics, superconductivity); Particles and fields physics; Nuclear physics; Fluids and plasma physics (including surface physics); Optics (including laser optics and quantum optics), Acoustics; Astronomy (including astrophysics, space science) 
 Example abstract: We study the minimal flavor violation in the context of string effective field theory. Stringy selection rules indicate that n-point couplings among fermionic zero-modes and lightest scalar modes in the string effective action are given by a product of Yukawa couplings which are regarded as spurion fields of stringy and geometrical symmetries. Hence, Yukawa couplings determine the dynamics of flavor and CP violations. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis of minimal flavor violation in the Standard Model effective field theory. 
chemical sciences: Organic chemistry; Inorganic and nuclear chemistry; Physical chemistry, Polymer science, Electrochemistry (dry cells, batteries, fuel cells, corrosion metals, electrolysis); Colloid chemistry; Analytical chemistry 
 Example abstract: In this study, we have developed an efficient protocol for synthesis of phosphorus-substituted heterocycles through reaction between 2-Aryl quinoxalines and dialkyl phosphites under transition-metal-free conditions. Here, K2S2O8 has been used as the sole oxidant for the facile synthesis of phosphorus substituted derivates. A variety of heteroaryl phosphonate derivatives have been synthesized under optimized conditions in good to excellent yields with this facile and environment friendly protocol. 
earth and related environmental sciences: Geosciences, multidisciplinary; Mineralogy; Palaeontology; Geochemistry and geophysics; Physical geography; Geology; Volcanology; Environmental sciences (social aspects to be in Social and economic geography); Meteorology and atmospheric sciences; climatic research; Oceanography, Hydrology, Water resources 
 Example abstract: This paper is dedicated to the memory of Vasily Nikolaevich Lykosov, a prominent Russian scientist and a specialist in the field of mathematical modeling of the dynamics of the turbulent boundary layer and its interaction with large-scale atmospheric circulation, global and regional climatic processes, and the active layer of the land. His scientific activities are briefly described in the context of modern research, one characteristic feature of which is attention to the links between local and global physical phenomena and a combination of theoretical models and numerical experiments. 
biological sciences: Not medical or agricultural, Cell biology, Microbiology; Virology; Biochemistry and molecular biology; Biochemical research methods; Mycology; Biophysics; Genetics and heredity (medical genetics to be 3); reproductive biology (medical aspects to be 3); developmental biology; Plant sciences, botany; Zoology, Ornithology, Entomology, Behavioural sciences biology; Marine biology, freshwater biology, limnology; Ecology; Biodiversity conservation; Biology (theoretical, mathematical, thermal, cryobiology, biological rhythm), Evolutionary biology; other biological topics 
 Example abstract: A new species of Cunaxidae, namely Cunaxa bagualensis Wurlitzer & Ferla sp. nov., is described and illustrated based on females and males collected in soil and leaf litter in the Atlantic rainforest biome in a rural forest fragment in Mormaco county, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Additionally, Armascirus livingstoni Laniecka & Kazmierski, 2021 is transferred to Dactyloscirus based on some observations. 
other natural sciences: Other natural sciences
