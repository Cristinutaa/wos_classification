 Example abstract: An intrinsic part of our lives as scientists, academic writing strongly affects our careers. Even great researchers are much more likely to be successful if they are also proficient writers. Unfortunately, many researchers prefer long hours spent in the field or laboratory to writing. Often, this is a result of their reluctance towards writing, something that characterizes not only scientists, but many people in general. But many researchers do not like writing because they do not know how to do it well-academic writing is not that simple. In this paper, I show how to improve your academic writing skills. I do not teach writing; instead, I share my experience about learning how to write. 
animal and dairy science: Animal and dairy science; Husbandry; Pets 
 Example abstract: Tomato cultivation and industrial processing produce a considerable amount of tomato pomace, peels, and seeds, which are difficult to handle. These by-products contain a variety of minerals and bioactive substances, and may thus be further valorized, generating additional revenue for processing plants while also decreasing environmental issues caused by their buildup. The inclusion of tomato pomace in poultry feed has been shown to produce promising effects in poultry growth and health, however the results are largely inconsistent. Literature has documented improvement in growth, egg production and quality, immunological and antioxidant effects in poultry. This review has complied the impacts of tomato pomace on the growth and health indices of poultry. 
veterinary science: Veterinary science 
 Example abstract: Background: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is the main diagnostic technique used for the confirmation of equine asthma. Use of the tracheal wash (TW) has been deemed insufficient to diagnose equine asthma or investigate poor performance, yet as TW is the easier sample to obtain it may be tempting to attempt this instead. Aim of the article: This update article provides a step-by-step guide to performing a BAL in the field, with the hope of encouraging more first-opinion equine vets to use this sampling technique. 
agricultural biotechnology: Agricultural biotechnology and food biotechnology; GM technology (crops and livestock), livestock cloning, marker assisted selection, diagnostics (DNA chips and biosensing devices for the early/accurate detection of diseases) biomass feedstock production technologies, biopharming; agricultural biotechnology related ethics 
 Example abstract:  
other agricultural sciences: Other agricultural sciences 
 Example abstract: The autohydrolysis process of eucalyptus hemicelluloses was studied. The effect of hydrolysis temperature and soaking time on the dissolution of hemicellulose from eucalyptus chips was considered, and the process conditions were further optimized by P factor. The kinetic equations for the hemicellulose reaction were derived by studying the reaction process of hemicellulose during the pre-hydrolysis of eucalyptus chips, based on the reaction activation energy of xylose from eucalyptus chips and the investigated reaction mechanism of eucalyptus pre-hydrolysis process. The results demonstrated the feasibility of efficient extraction and utilization of hemicellulose in the process of dissolving pulp preparation from eucalyptus chips. 
Return the most relevant classes for the FOLLOWING abstract. Return ONLY THE CLASSES separated by "&" in the ORDER OF RELEVANCE WITH THEIR RELEVANCE SCORE (between 0 and 100) in one line and never any aditional context: 
{} 
Please, DON'T RETURN OTHER CLASSES, ONLY A SUBSET OF THE 5, otherwise the result is invalid!!! The results of my study depends on it.
 DON'T RETURN MORE THAN FIVE RESULTS. ONLY THE MOST RELEVANT AND MAX 5 (1,2,3,4,5 RESULTS)!!!!
