 Example abstract: The mining and electricity sectors in Colombia have undergone a radical transformation in the last 30 years. This has several explanations, including the new laws regulating it, the creation of new authorities, changes in the market model, new technologies, climate change and energy transition. This article addresses how the mining and electricity sectors have evolved over the years since 1988, both in terms of the legislation and in its institutionality. Finally, the current situation of these sectors in Colombia and the challenges they face are analysed.

 Example abstract: An investigation on fractal-based sub-array (FBSA), of isotropic elements, that evolves from two Non-uniform Linear arrays, i.e. the minimum redundancy array and fractal Array, with a hole-free difference co-array shows competitive performance in direction of arrival estimation using (spatial smoothing-) MUSIC algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm can resolve 2 degrees separation between sources. Considering mutual coupling, in terms of RMSE, the FBSA performs better than other competing configurations.

 Example abstract: Satellite angular motion under the action of the Sdot one-axis magnetic control algorithm is analyzed. Sdot control stabilizes the maximum moment of inertia axis towards the Sun. Evolutionary equations that avoid singularity in the required position are derived. Linearization of equations is performed and new variables that describe the maximum moment of inertia axis oscillations amplitudes are introduced. The resulting equations are suitable for the averaging method application. Evolutionary equations for slow variables are solved. Simplified evolutionary expressions are verified with numerical simulation. 
chemical engineering: Chemical engineering (plants, products); Chemical process engineering 
 Example abstract: Liquid injection in fluidized beds is used to add reactants or to improve the heat management in the reactor. This injection will increase the complexity of reactor due to the formation of agglomerates. In this work the effect of the injection on the particle temperature distribution in a fluidized bed of porous particles is determined experimentally using particle image velocimetry and infra-red thermography. The main property of the porous particles influencing the distribution is the specific surface area. In addition, the porosity has a large effect on the defluidization of the fluidized bed.

 Example abstract: The possibility of forming coatings with a high content of amorphous phase by knock (detonation) spraying of a powder of alloy Fe66Cr10Nb5B19 of fraction 45 - 75 mu m is considered. Results of comparative tests of the coatings and of a stainless steel check test piece for abrasive wear under friction against nonrigidly fixed abrasive particles conducted according to ASTM G65D are presented. The wear mechanisms of the knock-sprayed coatings with partially crystallized structure are studied. 
medical engineering: Medical engineering; Medical laboratory technology (including laboratory samples analysis; diagnostic technologies); (Biomaterials to be in Industrial biotechnology [physical characteristics of living material as related to medical implants, devices, sensors]) 
 Example abstract: Multifractal behavior in the cepstrum representation of healthy and unhealthy infant cry signals is examined by means of wavelet leaders and compared using the Student t-test. The empirical results show that both expiration and inspiration signals exhibit clear evidence of multifractal properties under healthy and unhealthy conditions. In addition, expiration and inspiration signals exhibit more complexity under healthy conditions than under unhealthy conditions. Furthermore, distributions of multifractal characteristics are different across healthy and unhealthy conditions. Hence, this study improves the understanding of infant crying by providing a complete description of its intrinsic dynamics to better evaluate its health status.

 Example abstract: A physical model can be used to judge cementing quality to help drilling engineering. This article reports a physical model based on the XGboost algorithm to solve the cementing quality prediction problem of oil and gas wells. Through the physical model, the nonlinear, time-varying, and uncertain influencing factors, the high latitude of the data set, the lack of data, data imbalance and other characteristics are comprehensively analyzed. Finally, through numerical example verification, the physical model we reported can effectively predict the key factors affecting quality, improve process quality and reduce unit cost.

 Example abstract: Biopharmaceutical industries have advanced significantly after the millennium. Novel biopharmaceuticals have been developed one after another, and blockbuster drugs have been produced. Accompanying the increase in the demand for biopharmaceuticals, a business model called "contract development manufacturing organization (CDMO)" has emerged. A CDMO is entrusted with the development and manufacturing of production processes from pharmaceutical companies. In this review, we identify the success factors of the biopharmaceutical CDMO by analyzing the foundry business for the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, we also review monoclonal antibody production platforms and new technologies that are critical aspects of differentiation strategies in the biopharmaceutical CDMO.

 Example abstract: As bone biology develops, it is gradually recognized that bone regeneration is a pathophysiological process that requires the simultaneous participation of multiple systems. With the introduction of osteoimmunology, the interplay between the immune system and the musculoskeletal diseases has been the conceptual framework for a thorough understanding of both systems and the advancement of osteoimmunomodulaty biomaterials. Various therapeutic strategies which include intervention of the surface characteristics or the local delivery systems with the incorporation of bioactive molecules have been applied to create an ideal bone microenvironment for bone tissue regeneration. Our review systematically summarized the current research that is being undertaken in the field of osteoimmunomodulaty bone biomaterials on a case-by-case basis, aiming to inspire more extensive research and promote clinical conversion.

 Example abstract: The traditional infectious disease detection process is cumbersome, and there is only a single application scenario. In recent years, with the development of the medical industry and the impact of the epidemic situation, the number of infectious disease detection instruments based on nursing point detection has been increasing. Due to this trend, many detection instruments and massive detection data urgently need to be managed. In addition, the experiment failed due to the abnormal fluorescence curve generated by a human operator or sample impurities. Finally, the geographic information system has also played an active role in spreading and preventing infectious diseases; this paper designs a "detection-service-mobile" three-terminal system to realize the control of diagnostic instruments and the comprehensive management of data. Machine learning is used to classify the enlarged curve and calculate the cycle threshold of the positive curve; combined with a geographic information system, the detection results are marked on the mobile terminal map to realize the visual display of the positive results of nucleic acid amplification detection and the early warning of infectious diseases. In the research, applying this system to portable field pathogen detection is feasible and practical.
