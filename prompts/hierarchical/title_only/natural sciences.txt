N. Lykosov;Models of Climate, Geophysical Boundary Layers, and the Active Land Layer: In Memory of V. N. Lykosov 
biological sciences: NOTES ON THE NEST AND BREEDING OF GOELDI'S ANTBIRD (AKLETOS GOELDII), A BAMBOO SPECIALIST, FROM UCAYALI, PERU;Contribution to the knowledge of Chinese Gryllacrididae (Orthoptera) VI: new descriptions of Ocellarnaca Gorochov, 2004;Rosalydia, a new genus of Neocoelidiinae (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) from Brazilian Amazon, with description of three new species 
other natural sciences:  
Return the most relevant classes for the FOLLOWING abstract. Return ONLY THE CLASSES separated by "&" in the ORDER OF RELEVANCE WITH THEIR RELEVANCE SCORE (between 0 and 100) in one line and never any aditional context: 
{} 
Please, DON'T RETURN OTHER CLASSES, ONLY A SUBSET OF THE 7, otherwise the result is invalid!!! The results of my study depends on it.
 DON'T RETURN MORE THAN FIVE RESULTS. ONLY THE MOST RELEVANT AND MAX 5 (1,2,3,4,5 RESULTS)!!!! 
Example of answer: "earth and related environmental sciences:70&computer and information sciences:60"
