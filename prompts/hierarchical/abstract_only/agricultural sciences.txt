Given the following 5 classes: agriculture, forestry, and fisheries;animal and dairy science;veterinary science;agricultural biotechnology;other agricultural sciences 
The classes abstract example: 
agriculture, forestry, and fisheries: An intrinsic part of our lives as scientists, academic writing strongly affects our careers. Even great researchers are much more likely to be successful if they are also proficient writers. Unfortunately, many researchers prefer long hours spent in the field or laboratory to writing. Often, this is a result of their reluctance towards writing, something that characterizes not only scientists, but many people in general. But many researchers do not like writing because they do not know how to do it well-academic writing is not that simple. In this paper, I show how to improve your academic writing skills. I do not teach writing; instead, I share my experience about learning how to write. 
animal and dairy science: Animal breeding is an essential component of sustainable land-use systems with livestock. Therefore, it has to contribute its share to the solution of problems and conflicts in the areas of animal welfare, environmental impacts, land-use change and feed-food competition. An important lever is the reduction of the number of livestock and the turnover rates. This will give opportunities to keep the remaining animals in more open husbandry systems. Further efficiency improvements are necessary, but Jevons' Paradox has until today caused productivity improvement to be used to increase production instead of saving resources. Therefore, stronger regulations will be required to control the development of regional concentrations in line with consumer demands. 
veterinary science: Thoracolumbar lesions are common in horses, but their identification and location remain a challenge in field practice. A precise diagnostis improves therapeutic strategy and, thus, the prognosis of affected horses. Although radiography remains the preferred diagnostic imaging modality used for the back, ultrasound is a useful complementary technique that offers valuable information and can be performed as a stand-alone procedure when high-output radiographic equipment is not available. The aim of this paper is to describe thoracolumbar articular process joint pathology that can be visualised with ultrasound. 
agricultural biotechnology:  
other agricultural sciences: Studying the stress relaxation characteristics can provide important process parameters for the granulation and briquetting of biomass materials. In this study, a generalized Maxwell model and fractional model were established to describe and analyze the stress instantaneous drop behavior of a cornstraw-potato residue mixture during the stress relaxation process. Stress relaxation characteristic parameters, e.g., the stress instantaneous drop time, were obtained. Using this information, the influence of the compression speed on the stress instantaneous drop time, stress relaxation time ratio, and other parameters were analyzed. In addition, the regression model of the compression frequency and compression speed was established, which provided a method for determining the appropriate compression frequency of the molding equipment according to the compression speed. 
Return the most relevant classes for the FOLLOWING abstract. Return ONLY THE CLASSES separated by "&" in the ORDER OF RELEVANCE WITH THEIR RELEVANCE SCORE (between 0 and 100) in one line and never any aditional context: 
{} 
Please, DON'T RETURN OTHER CLASSES, ONLY A SUBSET OF THE 5, otherwise the result is invalid!!! The results of my study depends on it.
 DON'T RETURN MORE THAN FIVE RESULTS. ONLY THE MOST RELEVANT AND MAX 5 (1,2,3,4,5 RESULTS)!!!!
