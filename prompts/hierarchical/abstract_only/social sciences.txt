The classes abstract example: 
psychology: This study examined counselling self-efficacy (CSE) between international counselling students and domestic counselling students. Data were collected from 179 participants. Analysis of the data suggested similar levels of CSE scores between domestic and international counselling students, and between school counselling students and other master's-level counselling students. However, a significant difference was detected between master's- and doctoral-level counselling students in terms of their CSE scores. Implications for counsellor educators, counselling supervisors and the counselling profession are provided. 
economics and business: Drawing on a sample of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, we develop and test for a two-sided dynamic learning model to assess the degree of learning-by-lending in bank branches and learning-by-repaying for borrowers. The results show that learning-by-lending is negligible; however, learning-by-repaying is small but meaningful, with a shallow learning curve slope of 0.2. The findings have implications for two-sided learning and for policymakers aiming to lower defaults in SBA loans. 
educational sciences: In this article, the authors describe an English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher's attempt to provide more personalized support for her elementary English learners (ELs) during remote learning. The authors provide an in-depth description of using voice recorders, a low-tech and inexpensive device, to mitigate barriers and promote English development and literacy skills for ELs. They then describe the benefits of using this tool and provide ideas on how to extend the use of voice recorders for ELs during traditional instruction. 
sociology: Most Canadian federal government departments and agencies are required to conduct a "neutral assessment" of their evaluation function every five years. Such assessments should focus on the capacity of the evaluation units to produce high-quality evaluation reports which serve the needs of organizational decision-makers. Our study sought to analyze neutral assessment reports produced over a ten-year period. Overall, our review suggests that the neutral assessments consistently conform with central-agency requirements as well as indicate evolving evaluation capacity and utilization. We provide recommendations for improving the function and its impact. 
law: Radical democracy is usually fleeting. What are the possibilities for institutionalising it? If we want to understand them, we have to look carefully at the institutions and practices of local government and distance ourselves from the ideal of the nation-state, focusing instead on the possibilities of the open city. In that context, this article refers back to the work of Hannah Arendt and Robert Dahl, considering it in light of more recent contributions from Nancy Rosenblum, Andy Merrifield, Jacques Ranciere, and others. 
political science: We examine compensation as a tool to encourage the thoughtful use of audit experimentation. If researchers had to compensate subjects or communities, they would be more likely to avoid excessively large studies and to only conduct high-value studies. We build on Desposato and propose that when conducting an audit study, (1) researchers donate time or money to the communities potentially affected by the study, (2) researchers preregister this donation, and (3) researchers provide evidence of the donation they made in publication and presentation. 
social and economic geography: Starting from a comparison between the Belep Islands (Kanaky New Caledonia) and O'ahu (Hawai'i), this paper aims to contribute to the debates about islands and the Anthropocene, highlighting the relevance of the social and ecological responsibilities deriving from genealogical connections to the islands: 'the weight of the ancestors'. Considering the implications of these kinds of responsibilities can help to understand human and non-human relational entanglements better so as to value the agentive role of other-than-human perspectives. 
media and communications: To improve customer service, some academic libraries have used a service philosophy statement to foster a shared understanding of service standards. The authors conducted semi -structured interviews with heads of public services at academic libraries to understand how the service philosophy statement was used in practice and its impact on staff behavior and service quality. Findings indicated that the statement indeed helped staff cultivate a shared understanding, that public service leaders displayed a macro-level understanding of how a statement influences their service culture, and that there is no agreed-upon model for implementation. 
other social sciences: This research, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, applied Stanley Plog's seminal tourism Model of Allocentricity and Psychocentricity and discovered surprising relationships between one's Plog classification and their political attitudes and travel behaviors during the crisis. Though expecting Plog's Allocentrics to have the more politically liberal views and Psychocentrics to be more conservative, we found the opposite to be true. Two previous datasets were revisited, each confirming the relationship. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.
