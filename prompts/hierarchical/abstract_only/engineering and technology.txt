The classes abstract example: 
civil engineering: Transportation networks are critical components of lifeline systems. They can experience disruptions due to seismic hazards that could lead to severe emergency response and recovery problems. Finding an efficient and effective method to evaluate the seismic reliability of bridge networks is crucial for risk managers. This study proposes a method that can compute the seismic reliability of bridge networks using machine learning techniques. The proposed method is computationally less expensive than existing methods and can be implemented easily in emergency risk management systems. Moreover, it includes information on ranking bridges and prioritizing retrofit plans. 
electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering: The paper is devoted to the leader-follower approach for multiple mobile robots control and its experimental verification. The formation control of mobile robots is motivated by the concept of virtual leader tracking, which is enhanced by the collision avoidance between the robots proposed in our previous work. The effectiveness of this approach was verified through realisation of experiments with use of MTracker mobile robots. The OptiTrack vision system was used for robots localization. Software part with control algorithms and communication was prepared with use of the Robot Operating System. 
mechanical engineering: A computational fluid dynamics analysis of two-phase flow was used to obtain the distribution of lubricant in a journal bearing, including inlet tube and groove. It was found that for an incomplete starting film, the oil spread-length varies along the groove depth and film thickness. The magnitude of variation was found to be independent of the inlet mass flowrate. Numerical simulations of the proposed model show that in the cavitation region, the streamlets do not fill the entire film thickness. The present numerical model agrees with experimental observations. 
chemical engineering: High integrity protective systems (HIPS) are often introduced into the process design package during late-stage engineering for a new process or integrated with installed equipment in an existing process unit. The decision to use HIPS in addition to, or as an alternative to, a pressure relief device for a particular hazard scenario is generally based on a combination of factors, including technical, regulatory, and capital costs. This paper discusses functional, design, engineering, operation, and maintenance considerations that should be factored into the decision process when choosing HIPS to protect against overpressure scenarios. 
materials engineering: Microdefects in the rust layer of conventional steel and weathering steel were investigated by synchrotron X-ray micro tomography to understand the effect of defects on corrosion resistance. The rust layer of the weathering steel contained fewer and smaller defects than that of the conventional steel. A good correlation existed between the volume of defects and ion permeation of the rust layer obtained by EIS. In comparison with the conventional steel, the tomography results indicated that a protective layer formed on the weathering steel. 
medical engineering: Multifractal behavior in the cepstrum representation of healthy and unhealthy infant cry signals is examined by means of wavelet leaders and compared using the Student t-test. The empirical results show that both expiration and inspiration signals exhibit clear evidence of multifractal properties under healthy and unhealthy conditions. In addition, expiration and inspiration signals exhibit more complexity under healthy conditions than under unhealthy conditions. Furthermore, distributions of multifractal characteristics are different across healthy and unhealthy conditions. Hence, this study improves the understanding of infant crying by providing a complete description of its intrinsic dynamics to better evaluate its health status. 
environmental engineering: Methods proposed for mine water treatment use different advanced equipment such as aerators and circular settling tanks which ensure increase in pH and decrease in impurity concentrations by 10-50 times. Passive mine water treatment uses small cascade ponds, which enables additional purification of water due to deceleration in water flow velocity and because of the longer time of interaction between impurities and reagents. The reconstruction of the existing system of three treatment stages can reduce pollution of surface and ground water, which brings essential improvement of ecology and minimizes damage caused to the hydrosphere. 
environmental biotechnology: Therapeutic proteins or biologics are used to treat many diseases including cancer and autoimmune disorders, however, manufacturing these types of drugs typically requires enormous, costly facilities to meet demand and a cold supply chain for product transport, which often leads to logistical delays. A proposed solution to these issues is the development of a portable system to produce biotherapeutics at the pointof-care based on a miniaturized bioprocess. Some of the greatest challenges in this approach revolve around the purification section of the process, as certain difficulties arise from the scale-down of the downstream unit operations performed in traditional bioprocesses. We provide a brief overview of recent developments in portable, point-of-care biomanufacturing and ongoing challenges associated with downstream processing at this scale. 
industrial biotechnology: Granular porous calcium phosphate scaffolds are used for bone regeneration in dentistry. However, in conventional granules, the macropore interconnectivity is poor and has varying size. Herein, we developed a productive method for fabricating carbonate apatite honeycomb granules with uniformly sized macropores based on extrusion molding. Each honeycomb granule possesses three hexagonal macropores of ~290 mu m along its diagonal. Owing to these macropores, honeycomb granules simultaneously formed new and mature bone and blood vessels in both the interior and exterior of the granules at 4 weeks after implantation. The honeycomb granules are useful for achieving rapid osteogenesis and angiogenesis. 
nano-technology: Much research has been conducted on how patients may be served through new advances in perioperative anaesthetic care. However, adaptations of standardised care methodologies can only provide so many novel solutions for patients and caregivers alike. Similarly, unique methods such as nanoscopic liposomal package delivery for analgesics and affective numbing agents pose a similar issue-specifically that we are still left with the dilemma of patients for whom analgesics and numbing agents are ineffective or harmful. An examination of the potential gains that may result from the targeted development of nanorobotics for anaesthesia in perioperative care will be presented in this essay to help resolve this pending conflict for the research community. This examination should therefore serve as a "call to action" for such research and a "primer" for those for whom the method's implementation would most directly impact. 
other engineering and technologies: This paper presents a sustainability assessment of manufacturing processes for transport equipment, using fuzzy grey relational analysis. The metrics or sub-indicators for sustainability indicators and their relative applications in the manufacturing processes are used to create sustainability matrices, which are then compared with an ideal series in order to determine grades for the processes using the grey relational model. Grades in the form of values are determined for the performances of the manufacturing processes of four different kinds of transport equipment. The grades identified manufacturing processes in which the performance of the sustainability indicators could be improved.
