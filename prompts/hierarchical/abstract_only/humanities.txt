The classes abstract example: 
history: Mercantile migrants in Venice drew upon family ties and ruler's obligations to negotiate their rights and privileges. Drawing from a source base of immigrants' petitions to the Venetian Collegio and the Cinque Savi alla Mercanzia, this paper reveals that foreign merchants also exploited the ties of trust and reciprocity that traditionally bound ruler and subject in medieval and early modern supplication. However, immigrants confronted limits to reciprocity when it came to the authorities' moral or civic concerns in the regulation of space. 
archaeology: This paper argues that the Iron Age site of Khirbet Qeiyafa was a sacred cultic compound frequented by pilgrims rather than a proper fortified settlement. It is suggested that the casemate wall surrounding the site served as a compound wall demarcating the cultic precinct. These conclusions are based on the fact that the walled site had two gates, as well as on the size of the settled area, the massiveness of the wall, and the finds associated with cult uncovered in the excavations. 
languages and linguistics: This paper is part of a series of experimental studies that try to empirically chart the landscape of non-canonical uses of the particle nur 'only' in German, aiming at a comprehensive picture of how those uses can affect the interpretation of utterances in different clausal environments. While previous studies have focused on modal particle uses of German 'only' in wh-questions and imperatives, the present paper focuses on a non-canonical use in adverbial contexts, which has not been studied experimentally before. 
literature: This article intends to show that the misunderstanding among the reading public is not only a historical-cultural phenomenon capable of explaining the poor public reception of Baudelaire???s first poems. Being the subject of several of the poet???s writings, misunderstanding is incorporated into his poetry as an enunciative problem. After brief comments on the concept of ???dramatic poet???, coined by Barbey d???Aurevilly, I comment on some prose poems in which the misunderstanding is dramatized. 
philosophy and ethics: Skeptical arguments from dreaming deny that we can know that we are awake. This denial lacks initial credibility to many of us. Often it seems easy to know. A brief reflection seems sufficient. How might the reflection enable us to know? Berislav Marusic offers a plausible answer. The answer is that we can take note of certain phenomenal qualities that are present only when we are awake. The present work argues that there are no such qualities. The final section gives a different account of the knowledge. 
religion: There are passages in the Hebrew Bible in which the translation of the Hebrew G-stem verb /jaw as "to miss, fail to attain" makes better sense than its otherwise dominant meaning "to sin." Though modern Hebrew lexica allow for the occasional meaning of "to miss," many modern translations fail to consider "to miss" and insist on "to sin." The article examines eleven instances in the Bible where "to miss, fail to attain," makes better sense than the traditional "to sin," especially in the Wisdom literature. 
arts (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music): This Dialogue piece discusses costume on the film 'Lost in Translation' (2003) by Sophia Coppola. It argues that Lost in Translation employs costume as a fluent visual language that effectively communicates the character's identities and their relationship, but also as a means to indicate their transformation as they are displaced, and their evolving relation to the cultural setting where they are located, translating in this sense. Thus costume can be considered here not only a visual language, but also one in translation, perfectly matching the film's title. 
other humanities: Although not pendants in the traditional sense, since they were painted for different patrons, it is argued here that Carle Van Loo's 'A pasha having his mistress's portrait painted' and 'The Grand Turk giving a concert to his mistress, shown at the Salon of1737, were meant to be read as a pair - as portraits of the artist and his wife and as allegories of Painting and Music. By linking the paintings, Van Loo may have intended them to make a statement on the changing relations between art and patronage.
