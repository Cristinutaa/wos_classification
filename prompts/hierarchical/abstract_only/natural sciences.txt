Given the following 7 classes: mathematics;computer and information sciences;physical sciences;chemical sciences;earth and related environmental sciences;biological sciences;other natural sciences 
The classes abstract example: 
mathematics: We consider estimation of the scale parameter of an exponential distribution with unknown location under an arbitrary strictly convex loss function when samples are progressive type II censored. Stein-type procedures, improving upon the minimum risk equivariant (MRE) estimator, are obtained and illustrated upon using quadratic and entropy loss functions. We also study a class of improving estimators using the integral expression of risk difference (IERD) method and useful consequences are discussed. Some known procedures are shown to belong to the proposed class of estimators. 
computer and information sciences: Tools that focus on static code analysis for early error detection are of utmost importance in software development, especially since the propagation of errors is strongly related to higher costs in the development process. Formal Concept Analysis is a prominent field of applied mathematics that uses conceptual landscapes to discover and represent maximal clusters of data. Its expressive visualization method makes it suitable for exploratory analyses in different fields. In this paper we present a Formal Concept Analysis framework for static code analysis that can serve as a model for quantitative and qualitative exploration and interpretation of such results. 
physical sciences: We study the minimal flavor violation in the context of string effective field theory. Stringy selection rules indicate that n-point couplings among fermionic zero-modes and lightest scalar modes in the string effective action are given by a product of Yukawa couplings which are regarded as spurion fields of stringy and geometrical symmetries. Hence, Yukawa couplings determine the dynamics of flavor and CP violations. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis of minimal flavor violation in the Standard Model effective field theory. 
chemical sciences: Efficient photocatalytic aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation reactions of N,N-disubstituted hydroxylamines to nitrones were developed with an in situ generated photocatalyst based on commercially available 3,6-dichlorotetrazine. This process affords a wide range of nitrones in high yields under mild conditions. In addition, an oxidative (3+3) cycloaddition between an oxyallyl cation precursor and a hydroxylamine was also developed. 
earth and related environmental sciences: This paper is dedicated to the memory of Vasily Nikolaevich Lykosov, a prominent Russian scientist and a specialist in the field of mathematical modeling of the dynamics of the turbulent boundary layer and its interaction with large-scale atmospheric circulation, global and regional climatic processes, and the active layer of the land. His scientific activities are briefly described in the context of modern research, one characteristic feature of which is attention to the links between local and global physical phenomena and a combination of theoretical models and numerical experiments. 
biological sciences: In this paper, we report one new species, viz. Ocellarnaca longilobulata sp. nov. (Chinese name: ), and provide the descriptions of tegminal veins and morphological illustrations of Ocellarnaca fuscotessellata (Karny, 1926) (Chinese name:) and Ocellarnaca furcifera (Karny, 1926) (Chinese name:). All the specimens are deposited in Guangxi Normal University.
