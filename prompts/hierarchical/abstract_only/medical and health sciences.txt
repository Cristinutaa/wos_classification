Given the following 5 classes: basic medicine;clinical medicine;health sciences;health biotechnology;other medical sciences 
The classes abstract example: 
basic medicine: One of the greatest challenges in business consulting is to help clients quickly grasp how the products and services you offer will improve their organizations. As businesswomen whose adult lives have been spent implementing behavioral solutions in large companies and complex organizations, we have amassed experience and advice for those who seek to help others achieve sustainable improvements through behaviorally based solutions. It starts with getting them to understand and believe in what you are proposing. This paper outlines advice and strategies gained over three decades of marketing and implementing behavioral solutions in large organizations. 
clinical medicine: Cardiac symptoms or signs as the first manifestations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients are sporadically reported which lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis due to lack of clinical experience and improper diagnosis procedures. Here, we documented the clinical features, procedures of diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes from the so-far reported 30 lymphoblastic leukemia cases that initially presented as cardiac problems and provided management recommendations based on the experiences and lessons learned from these patients to help physicians avoid misdiagnosis and improper treatment. 
health sciences: We analyzed the first 255 PCR-confirmed cases of mon-keypox in Italy in 2022. Preliminary estimates indicate mean incubation period of 9.1 (95% CI 6.5-10.9) days, mean generation time of 12.5 (95% CI 7.5-17.3) days, and reproduction number among men who have sex with men of 2.43 (95% CI 1.82-3.26). 
health biotechnology: Autologous cell therapy uses patients' own cells to deliver precise and ideal treatment through a personalized medicine approach. Isolation of patients' cells from residual tissue extracted during surgery involves specific planning and lab steps. In the present manuscript, a path from isolation to in vitro research with human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from residual bone tissues is described as performed by a medical unit in collaboration with a research center. Ethical issues have been addressed by formulating appropriate harvesting protocols according to European regulations. Samples were collected from 19 patients; 10 of them were viable and after processing resulted in MSCs. MSCs were further differentiated in osteoblasts to investigate the biocompatibility of several 3D scaffolds produced by electrospinning and 3D printing technologies; traditional orthopedic titanium and nanostructured titanium substrates were also tested. 3D printed scaffolds proved superior compared to other substrates, enabling significantly improved response in osteoblast cells, indicating that their biomimetic structure and properties make them suitable for synthetic tissue engineering. The present research is a proof of concept that describes the process of primary stem cells isolation for in vitro research and opens avenues for the development of personalized cell platforms in the case of patients with orthopedic trauma. The demonstration model has promising perspectives in personalized medicine practices.

Return the most relevant classes for the FOLLOWING abstract. Return ONLY THE CLASSES separated by "&" in the ORDER OF RELEVANCE WITH THEIR RELEVANCE SCORE (between 0 and 100) in one line and never any aditional context: 
{} 
Please, DON'T RETURN OTHER CLASSES, ONLY A SUBSET OF THE 5, otherwise the result is invalid!!! The results of my study depends on it.
 DON'T RETURN MORE THAN FIVE RESULTS. ONLY THE MOST RELEVANT AND MAX 5 (1,2,3,4,5 RESULTS)!!!!
