Given the abstract '{}' and the disciplines 'electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering' and 'industrial biotechnology', with the descriptions:
'Electrical and electronic engineering; Robotics and automatic control; Automation and control systems; Communication engineering and systems; telecommunications; Computer hardware and architecture' (for electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering) and
'Industrial biotechnology; Bioprocessing technologies (industrial processes relying on biological agents to drive the process) biocatalysis, fermentation; bioproducts (products that are manufactured using biological material as feedstock) biomaterials, bioplastics, biofuels, bioderived bulk and fine chemicals, bio-derived novel materials' (for industrial biotechnology), which one is more relevant? Choose only one and only write your choice, no additional information. Choose only between 'electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering' and 'industrial biotechnology'
