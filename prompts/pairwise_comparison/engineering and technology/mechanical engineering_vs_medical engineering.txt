Given the abstract '{}' and the disciplines 'mechanical engineering' and 'medical engineering', with the descriptions:
'Mechanical engineering; Applied mechanics; Thermodynamics; Aerospace engineering; Nuclear related engineering; (nuclear physics to be in Physical sciences); Audio engineering, reliability analysis' (for mechanical engineering) and
'Medical engineering; Medical laboratory technology (including laboratory samples analysis; diagnostic technologies); (Biomaterials to be in Industrial biotechnology [physical characteristics of living material as related to medical implants, devices, sensors])' (for medical engineering), which one is more relevant? Choose only one and only write your choice, no additional information. Choose only between 'mechanical engineering' and 'medical engineering'
