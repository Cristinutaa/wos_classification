Given the abstract '{}' and the disciplines 'medical engineering' and 'industrial biotechnology', with the descriptions:
'Medical engineering; Medical laboratory technology (including laboratory samples analysis; diagnostic technologies); (Biomaterials to be in Industrial biotechnology [physical characteristics of living material as related to medical implants, devices, sensors])' (for medical engineering) and
'Industrial biotechnology; Bioprocessing technologies (industrial processes relying on biological agents to drive the process) biocatalysis, fermentation; bioproducts (products that are manufactured using biological material as feedstock) biomaterials, bioplastics, biofuels, bioderived bulk and fine chemicals, bio-derived novel materials' (for industrial biotechnology), which one is more relevant? Choose only one and only write your choice, no additional information. Choose only between 'medical engineering' and 'industrial biotechnology'
